Hamamatsu
---------

Reader for spectroscopy data saved in ``.img`` (ITEX) files from the HPD-TA
(High Performance Digital Temporal Analyzer) or HiPic (High Performance image control)
softwares from Hamamatsu, e.g. for images from streak cameras or high performance
CCD cameras.

If `LumiSpy <https://lumispy.org>`_ is installed, ``LumiTransientSpectrum`` will be
used as the ``signal_type``, which is intended for streak camera images with
both wavelength and time axes.

.. Note::

   Currently, reading files containing multiple channels or multiple images per
   channel is not implemented.
