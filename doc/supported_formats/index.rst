Supported formats
=================

The different file formats currently supported by RosettaSciIO are
summarized here, indicating whether only **reading** from or also **writing** to
the respective formats is implemented. In particular, binary file formats will
usually be read-only. The **lazy** column specifies whether
:external+hyperspy:ref:`lazy loading <big-data-label>` (and thus evaluation) of
big datasets is supported.

.. note:: We'd also like to thank the :ref:`companies<supporting_your_file_format>` who have contributed to the development and support of
   RosettaSciIO plugins for the file formats associated with their products.
