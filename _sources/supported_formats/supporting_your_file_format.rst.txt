Supporting Your File Format
===========================

**Many companies have decided to develop and support plugins for their own file formats or the file formats associated with their products and we strongly support and encourage this commitment.**
This engagement helps ensure that the data is being read correctly and often allows for a more comprehensive file reading and metadata parsing. For companies, it has the advantage that customers/users get easy access to the vast possibilities of data analysis using various scientific python packages.
If you are a user of RosettaSciIO or HyperSpy and have a file format that you would like to have support for, please consider
contacting the company to ask them to support their file format in RosettaSciIO.

The following is a list of companies that are currently or have previously supported the reading/writing
of their file formats in RosettaSciIO.  We would like to thank them for their support and continued commitment to open
file formats.

.. note:: We are always looking for more companies to support their file formats.
   If you represent a company that would like to support their file format or have previously supported it,
   please raise an `issue on GitHub <https://github.com/hyperspy/rosettasciio/issues>`_ or make a pull 
   request on GitHub to add support - see the :ref:`contributing guide <contributing>` for more information.
